## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My app will help improve the communication between managers and employees to improve work flow and
work performance in retail stores. The app will have 3 main navigation tabs. One for Notification,
second one for scheduling and third one for grill timer. The notification will have 4 sub tabs. The
first one is for
Urgent messages, second one for General messages, third one for completed Tasks/messages, fourth one
for Daily Tasks.
In the app a user/employee will be able to signup and login to leave a note or post a message. Check
his/her schedule. And use a mobile device to control the time food stays in a grill. Also managers can
notify a person in charge about anything new even though they are away (post a note or message from
  their mobile device).
The idea was initiated from my work place. The managers leave us a note or message in a piece of
paper, and sometimes if they forget to mention it, a task remains undone. The manager also uses a paper to
renew our schedule every week, so if I am off in the day of schedule cycle, He has to remind me of my next day
schedule or i have to ask him about my next schedule. Finally we use a paper to write the time a food
is put in the display grill and calculate the time it will be ready and expire, and remember to move
it forward in the grill when it is ready.
